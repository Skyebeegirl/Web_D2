<p id="id1"><b> Once upon a time, there was a little girl who lived in a village near the forest. Whenever she went out, the little girl wore a red riding cloak, so everyone in the village called her Little Red Riding Hood. <br>

	One morning, Little Red Riding Hood asked her mother if she could go to visit her grandmother as it had been awhile since they'd seen each other.<br>

"That's a good idea," her mother said.  So they packed a nice basket for Little Red Riding Hood to take to her grandmother.<br>

"Remember, go straight to Grandma's house," her mother cautioned.  "Don't dawdle along the way and please don't talk to strangers!  The woods are dangerous."<br>

"Don't worry, mommy," said Little Red Riding Hood, "I'll be careful."<br>

But when Little Red Riding Hood noticed some lovely flowers in the woods, she forgot her promise to her mother.  She picked a few, watched the butterflies flit about for awhile, listened to the frogs croaking and then picked a few more.<br> 

Little Red Riding Hood was enjoying the warm summer day so much, that she didn't notice a dark shadow approaching out of the forest behind her...<br>

<i>Suddenly, the wolf appeared beside her.</i><br>

"What are you doing out here, little girl?" the wolf asked in a voice as friendly as he could muster.<br>

"I'm on my way to see my Grandma who lives through the forest, near the brook,"  Little Red Riding Hood replied.<br>

Then she realized how late she was and quickly excused herself, rushing down the path to her Grandma's house.<br>

When the basket was ready, the little girl put on her red cloak and kissed her mother goodbye.<br>

The wolf, in the meantime, took a shortcut...<br>


The wolf, in the meantime, took a shortcut...<br>


The wolf, a little out of breath from running, arrived at Grandma's and knocked lightly at the door.<br>


"Oh thank goodness dear!  Come in, come in!  I was worried sick that something had happened to you in the forest," said Grandma thinking that the knock was her granddaughter.<br>


The wolf let himself in.  Poor Granny did not have time to say another word, before the wolf gobbled her up!<br>


The wolf let out a satisfied burp, and then poked through Granny's wardrobe to find a nightgown that he liked.  He added a frilly sleeping cap, and for good measure, dabbed some of Granny's perfume behind his pointy ears. <br>


A few minutes later, Red Riding Hood knocked on the door.  The wolf jumped into bed and pulled the covers over his nose.  "Who is it?" he called in a cackly voice.<br>


"It's me, Little Red Riding Hood."<br>


"Oh how lovely!  Do come in, my dear," croaked the wolf.<br>


When Little Red Riding Hood entered the little cottage, she could scarcely recognize her Grandmother.<br>


"Grandmother!  Your voice sounds so odd.  Is something the matter?" she asked.<br>


"Oh, I just have touch of a cold," squeaked the wolf adding a cough at the end to prove the point.<br>


"But Grandmother!  What big ears you have," said Little Red Riding Hood as she edged closer to the bed.<br>


"The better to hear you with, my dear," replied the wolf.<br>


"But Grandmother!  What big eyes you have," said Little Red Riding Hood.<br>

"The better to see you with, my dear," replied the wolf.<br>


"But Grandmother!  What big teeth you have," said Little Red Riding Hood her voice quivering slightly.<br>


"The better to eat you with, my dear," roared the wolf and he leapt out of the bed and began to chase the little girl.<br>


Almost too late, Little Red Riding Hood realized that the person in the bed was not her Grandmother, but a hungry wolf.<br>


She ran across the room and through the door, shouting, "Help!  Wolf!" as loudly as she could.<br>


<mark>A woodsman who was chopping logs nearby heard her cry and ran towards the cottage as fast as he could.</mark><br>


He grabbed the wolf and made him spit out the poor Grandmother who was a bit frazzled by the whole experience, but still in one piece."Oh Grandma, I was so scared!"  sobbed Little Red Riding Hood, "I'll never speak to strangers or dawdle in the forest again."<br>


"There, there, child.  You've learned an important lesson.  Thank goodness you shouted loud enough for this kind woodsman to hear you!"<br>


The woodsman knocked out the wolf and carried him deep into the forest where he wouldn't bother people any longer.<br>


Little Red Riding Hood and her Grandmother had a nice lunch and a long chat.<br></b>
